In some embodiments, a three-dimensional matrix is developed by stacking of volumetric data and the bony structure is segmented through thresholding. Initially a seed point is searched for initializing the process of landmark detection. Two three-dimensional distance vectors are used to define and obtain the Volume of Interest (VOI). First 3-D distance vector helps to identify Empirical Point and consecutively second gives dimensions of the VOI. Three-dimensional contours of anatomical structure are traced in the estimated VOI. Cephalometric landmarks are identified on the boundaries of traced anatomical geometry, based on corresponding Mathematical Entities. Detected landmark can be used as a Reference Point for further detection of landmarks. Estimating the VOI and detection of points continues till all desired landmarks are detected. The detection procedure gives three-dimensional coordinate locations of the landmarks.

In one embodiment, radiologists are parameterized and then matched with requests for radiological readings based on information extracted from DICOM image headers and merged with associated information contained in a medical work order. In this embodiment, the radiologists are parameterized based on their locations, schedules, hospital credentials, state licensing, compensation metrics, and performance metrics and incoming requests for review of CT scans and the like are filtered based on the parameterized radiologist information to identify one or more radiologists who are to fulfill the medical request.

     A centrally controlled healthcare environment interconnects manufacturers of medical products, healthcare providers, and patients in a manner that provides a variety of functionalities. A particularly advantageous application of the system provides a mechanism for regulating and recording the flow of free drug samples from manufacturers to healthcare providers and then to patients. This involves a method by which a unique record is created each time it changes hands on the way from the manufacturer to the patient. A machine-readable unique code assigned to the sample is scanned automatically when the sample it is withdrawn from inventory at the manufacturer. The code and a unique identity of the individual withdrawing the sample are stored as a first record. This process is repeated at each location and for each individual handling the sample, including when it reaches the healthcare provider. Thus, a series of unique records is created that track the sample.

     The technology relates to detecting and responding to emergency vehicles. This may include using a plurality of microphones to detect a siren noise corresponding to an emergency vehicle and to estimate a bearing of the emergency vehicle. This estimated bearing is compared to map information to identify a portion of roadway on which the emergency vehicle is traveling. In addition, information identifying a set of objects in the vehicle's environment as well as characteristics of those objects is received from a perception system is used to determine whether one of the set of objects corresponds to the emergency vehicle. How to respond to the emergency vehicle is determined based on the estimated bearing and identified road segments and the determination of whether one of the set of objects corresponds to the emergency vehicle. This determined response is then used to control the vehicle in an autonomous driving mode.

     One or more techniques and/or systems are provided for determining a scaled flow rate of traffic for a road segment. For example, probe flow rate information is determined based upon locational information from one or more probe vehicles on a road segment (e.g., a flow rate of probe vehicles corresponding to a sum of probe vehicles identified from time stamped global positioning system coordinates provided by the probe vehicles). Satellite imagery of the road segment is analyzed to identify a count of vehicles on the road segment. Scale factor and offset information is estimated based upon the probe flow rate information and the count of vehicles. The scale factor and offset information is used to scale the probe flow rate information to determine a scaled flow rate that may be a relatively accurate flow rate of traffic, which may correspond to an inferred traffic volume along the road segment.

The system includes a linguistic interface to a user and a parser for processing linguistic events from the user. A dialog manager of the system is configured to receive alternative outputs from the parser, and selecting an action and causing the action to be performed based on the received alternative outputs. The system further includes a dialog state for an interaction with the user, and the alternative outputs represent alternative transitions from a current dialog state to a next dialog state. The system further includes a storage for a plurality of templates, and wherein each dialog state is defined in terms of an interrelationship of one or more instances of the templates.
